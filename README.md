// (Description) This website should be a static representation of an adobe xd design. Which you can find at this url(https://xd.adobe.com/spec/5c97cdf9-bda2-47f1-7c8f-27c7fd5963dd-2aa6/grid). Website should have a working navbar and should match up to the adobe design. Pages that should be there include-- Home Page (index.html), About (page1.html), Menu (page2.html), Catering (page3.html), and Photos (page4.html). All pages should have a footer and contact at the end of each page.

// desc - The spacing and everything else looks identical to the puppy hotel document, I would like to see images in the about page but it is fine without it. Nice job!
